## Overflow
Is a thing. Sign overflow happens. Can't have overflow if pos + negative, can if same sign.

Multiplication follows similar rules, but need to pay more attention at the binary level. Recall how to do it by hand -- same way in binary. It only works well for signed values, not for unsigned values.
