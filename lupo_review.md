## 3a) See paper notes

## Last problem, pipeline hw

BTAC (Branch Target Access Cache): purpose is which instruction to fetch next, use last 3 bits.

0 - WT - loop

For the second one, we assume forward branches are weakly not taken and backwards are strongly taken.
The address after this branch would be L2

**BTAC**

|Position | Branch type | Destination|
| ------- | --------- | ------- |
|0 | Weakly Taken | loop |
| 6 | Strongly Taken | L2 |

## Final, Problem 5: See paper notes
